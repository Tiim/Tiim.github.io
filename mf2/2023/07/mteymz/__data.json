My inbox is indeed reserved for \"for things that require my attention\". That is why only a very small number of feeds go to my inbox (like WebMention replies to my posts). The vast majority of feeds go into dedicated folders with no notifications. So in a way these folders are my feed reader. The only relation that they have to my \"normal email workflow\" is that the exist in the same app. When I say I get my feeds via email lots of people immediately picture having feeds show up in their regular email workflow and are (rightfully) mortified. I think this approach would work well for almost no one. I think it is very important to have separation by priority much like Thunderbird has a separate news feed rather than dumping the feeds into your inbox. The difference here is that the separation is different folders in the same IMAP account rather than a distinct news account.","Kevin","2024-01-20T09:36:14Z",{"html":45,"slug":46,"uuid":47,"date":48,"created":49,"published":31,"abstract":50,"tags":51,"links":-1,"type":52,"cover_image":-1,"description":14,"folder":53},"\u003Cp>Hi, my name is \u003Cspan class=\"p-name\">Tim Bachmann\u003C/span>!\nI'm a \u003Cspan class=\"p-role\">master graduate in computer science\u003C/span> at \u003Cspan class=\"p-org\">University of Basel\u003C/span>, swimmer and swim coach.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I am passionate about all things web development, swimming, personal knowledge management and much more.\nIf you liked this or any of my posts, feel free to \u003Ca href=\"https://tiim.ch/follow\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">follow me\u003C/a>.\u003C/p>","about","d8e56802-2847-4053-b213-9b004f1b965c",["Date","2022-10-15T00:00:00.000Z"],["Date","2022-10-15T19:47:09.652Z"],"\u003Cp>Hi, my name is {{name}}!\nI'm a {{role}} at {{org}}, swimmer and swim coach.\u003C/p>",[],"article","metadata"],"uses":{"params":["slug"]}}]}
