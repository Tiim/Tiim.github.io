My inbox is indeed reserved for \"for things that require my attention\". That is why only a very small number of feeds go to my inbox (like WebMention replies to my posts). The vast majority of feeds go into dedicated folders with no notifications. So in a way these folders are my feed reader. The only relation that they have to my \"normal email workflow\" is that the exist in the same app. When I say I get my feeds via email lots of people immediately picture having feeds show up in their regular email workflow and are (rightfully) mortified. I think this approach would work well for almost no one. I think it is very important to have separation by priority much like Thunderbird has a separate news feed rather than dumping the feeds into your inbox. The difference here is that the separation is different folders in the same IMAP account rather than a distinct news account.","Kevin","2024-01-20T09:36:14Z",{"html":46,"slug":47,"date":48,"content_tags":49,"photos":52,"raw_data":55,"abstract":46,"tags":71,"links":-1,"published":32,"type":73,"cover_image":54,"description":15,"folder":35,"comments":74,"latestComment":44},"\u003Cp>The first snow of this winter!
