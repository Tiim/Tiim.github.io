Although, it started to bug me that I felt the need to regularly check IRC in case I missed someone potentially tagging or private-messaging me. While looking around at how I could be notified on mentions and private messages, I found the \u003Ca href=\"https://weechat.org/files/doc/stable/weechat_user.en.html#trigger\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">trigger plugin\u003C/a>. A powerful plugin that comes pre-installed on WeeChat. It lets the user specify a WeeChat command that will be executed when a specific event occurs. This plugin is probably powerful enough to build a small IRC bot, directly in WeeChat.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Also, I recently found the web service \u003Ca href=\"https://ntfy.sh\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">ntfy.sh\u003C/a>. It sends push notifications whenever you send an HTTP post request to a certain URL. I already have ntfy.sh installed on my android phone, and I also found a minimal and lightweight \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/lucas-bortoli/ntfysh-windows\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">desktop client\u003C/a>.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I managed to set a WeeChat trigger up that fires every time I get mentioned (highlighted in WeeChat terminology), and a trigger that fires every time I get a private message. Both of those triggers execute the \u003Ccode>/exec\u003C/code> command which runs an arbitrary shell command. The exec command runs the \u003Ccode>wget\u003C/code> program to send a post request to the ntfy.sh server, which in turn sends a notification to all apps that subscribe to the same URL as the post request was sent. I would usually use the curl program for this instead of wget, but the docker default docker image doesn't contain a curl install.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Here you can see the two \u003Ccode>/trigger\u003C/code> commands:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cem>trigger on mention\u003C/em>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cpre>\u003Ccode>/trigger addreplace notify_highlight print '' '${tg_highlight}' '/.*/${weechat.look.nick_prefix}${tg_prefix_nocolor}${weechat.look.nick_suffix} ${tg_message_nocolor}/' '/exec -norc -nosw -bg wget -O- --post-data \"${tg_message}\" \"-                   -header=Title: New highlight: ${buffer.full_name}\" https://ntfy.sh/my_ntfy_topic_1234'\n\u003C/code>\u003C/pre>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cem>trigger on private message\u003C/em>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cpre>\u003Ccode class=\"language-weechat\">/trigger addreplace notify_privmsg print '' '${tg_tag_notify} == private &#x26;&#x26; ${buffer.notify} > 0' '/.*/${weechat.look.nick_prefix}${tg_prefix_nocolor}${weechat.look.nick_suffix} ${tg_message_nocolor}/' '/exec -norc -nosw -bg wget -O- --post-data \"${tg_message}\" \"--header=Title: New private message: ${buffer.full_name}\" https://ntfy.sh/my_ntfy_topic_1234'\n\u003C/code>\u003C/pre>\n\u003Ch2>The trigger commands in detail\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>In case you don't just want to copy and paste some random command from the internet into your WeeChat (which you shouldn't do anyway), I will try to explain the trigger command that fires when you get mentioned in a message:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Let's first look at the trigger command itself:\n\u003Ccode>/trigger addreplace &#x3C;name> &#x3C;hook> &#x3C;argument> &#x3C;condition> &#x3C;variable-replace> &#x3C;command>\u003C/code>\nWe call the \u003Ccode>/trigger\u003C/code> command with the \u003Ccode>addreplace\u003C/code> subcommand. This subcommand will either register a new trigger or replace it if one with the same name already exists.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>\u003Ccode>name\u003C/code> - This argument is self-explanatory, the name of the trigger. In our case I called it \u003Ccode>notify_highlight\u003C/code>, but you could call it whatever you want.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Ccode>hook\u003C/code> - This argument specifies which hook or event the trigger should listen for. WeeChat is built as an event-driven platform, so pretty much anything from mouse movements to IRC messages are handled via events. In this case, we want to trigger on the \u003Ccode>print\u003C/code> event, which is fired every time a new message gets received from IRC.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Ccode>argument\u003C/code> - The argument is needed for some hooks, but not for the \u003Ccode>print\u003C/code> hook, so we are going to ignore that one for now and just set it to an empty string \u003Ccode>''\u003C/code>.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Ccode>condition\u003C/code> - The condition must evaluate to \u003Ccode>true\u003C/code> for the trigger to fire. This is helpful because the \u003Ccode>print\u003C/code> trigger fires for every new message, but we only want to be notified when the new message mentions our nick. The condition for this is \u003Ccode>${tg_highlight}\u003C/code>. You can find the list of variables that you can access with the command \u003Ccode>/trigger monitor\u003C/code>, which prints all variables for every trigger that gets executed.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Ccode>variable-replace\u003C/code> - This took me a while to understand. This command is used to manipulate data and save it to a variable. The syntax is inspired by the sed command. Explaining it fully is out of the scope of this blog post, but you can take a look at the \u003Ca href=\"https://weechat.org/files/doc/devel/weechat_user.en.html#trigger_regex\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">docs\u003C/a>. In our example, we replace the whole content of the variable \u003Ccode>tg_message\u003C/code> with the format string \u003Ccode>${weechat.look.nick_prefix}${tg_prefix_nocolor}${weechat.look.nick_suffix} ${tg_message_nocolor}\u003C/code> which results in a string like \u003Ccode>&#x3C;tiim> Hello world!\u003C/code>.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Ccode>command\u003C/code> - The last argument is the command that gets executed whenever this trigger fires. In our case, we use the \u003Ccode>/execute\u003C/code> command, which starts the wget command which in turn sends a post request to ntfy.sh. Make sure you set the ntfy topic (the part after \u003Ccode>https://ntfy.sh/\u003C/code>) to something private and long enough so that nobody else is going to guess it by accident.\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Cp>Don't forget to subscribe to the ntfy topic on your phone or whatever device you want to receive the notification on.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The possibilities with the trigger plugin are endless, I hope this inspires you to build your own customizations using weechat.\u003C/p>","blog/2023-03-28-weechat-notification-ntfy","ef51e944-86fa-44b0-ab9d-be7f8d8e569a",["Date","2023-03-28T10:05:19.000Z"],["Date","2023-01-15T20:35:40.643Z"],[9],null,"Weechat Notifications with ntfy.sh",true,"Using the weechat trigger plugin to notify yourself about new private messages and mentions through the ntfy.sh notification service.","https://media.tiim.ch/97833b1d-d602-4d9a-9689-3077e96e45ba.webp","stable diffusion - Anything V3.0 - boy using an old DOS computer, 90s vibes, muted pastel colors, stylized, thick lines, IRC, console",[16,17,18,19],"weechat","ntfy.sh","wget","irc","\u003Cp>In one of my last blog posts I \u003Ca href=\"https://tiim.ch/blog/2023-01-15-weechat-docker\">set up WeeChat in docker\u003C/a>, which works mostly pretty great for me so far.
