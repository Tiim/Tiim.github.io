When you successfully paired the phone once you will not have to do this again. Now you need an app that will tell the phone that it can use the PC as a wireless speaker. The only app I found that will do this is the \u003Ca href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/de-de/p/bluetooth-audio-receiver/9n9wclwdqs5j\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Bluetooth Audio Receiver\u003C/a> app from the Windows Store. Install and and open it. You should see your phone on the list of Bluetooth devices on the app. Select it and click on the \u003Ccode>Open Connection\u003C/code> button. It might take a moment but after it connected, you should hear all sounds from your phone on your PC.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2>Wired\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Requirements\u003C/strong>:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>Male-to-Male audio cable (3.5mm audio jack).\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>A line-in port on your PC (usually blue audio jack on the back)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>USB-C to audio jack adapter (Optional)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Lighting to audio jack adapter (Optional)\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Cp>This approach works if your PC doesn't support Bluetooth, or if the Bluetooth connection drops for some reason. Connect the audio cable to the blue line-in jack on the back of the computer. Then, connect the phone to the other end of the audio cable. If your phone does not have an audio jack, use the adapter on the USB-C or Lightning port. If your PC detects that you connected a new line-in device, it might open the audio settings automatically. If not, right-click on the volume icon on the taskbar next to the clock and select \u003Ccode>Sounds\u003C/code>. Navigate to the \u003Ccode>Input\u003C/code> tab and double click on the Line-In entry (the one with a cable icon). Navigate to the Monitor tab and select the check box for \"Use this device as a playback source\". This will tell windows it should play all sounds received through this input directly to the speakers. Usually this is used to monitor microphones but it works for this use case too. You should now hear any sound from your phone through your PC headphones or speakers. Make sure you turn this checkbox off when you disconnect your phone. Otherwise you might hear a crackle or other sounds when the loose cable gets touched.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cem>Photo by Lisa Fotios from Pexels\u003C/em>\u003C/p>","blog/2022-02-phone-audio-to-pc","be57f2df-d58f-4b79-8a51-e20d482f46cf","How to Listen to Phone Audio on PC",true,["Date","2022-02-12T00:00:00.000Z"],"Learn how to connect your phone audio to your PC over wire or Bluetooth.","/assets/2022-02-phone-audio-to-pc.jpg",[12,13,14,15,16],"how-to","audio","windows","bluetooth","software","\u003Cp>Did you ever want to listen to your phone audio on your PC?
