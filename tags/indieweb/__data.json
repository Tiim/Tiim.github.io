At first I just embedded them in the website github repository, but this just doesn't feel right. Putting one or two image assets in a codebase is one thing, putting an ever growing list of images in there feels icky to me. For this reason I put the last few cover images of my blog posts on the imgur platform. This is slightly cleaner from a git standpoint but now i have to trust imgur to keep serving these images. Additionally, as I recently discovered, this seems to be against imgurs \u003Ca href=\"https://imgur.com/tos\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">TOS\u003C/a>:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>[...] Also, don't use Imgur to host image libraries you link to from elsewhere, content for your website, advertising, avatars, or anything else that turns us into your content delivery network.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>Finally when I started \u003Ca href=\"https://tiim.ch/blog/2022-12-indiewebifying-my-website-part-1\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">indie-webifying my website\u003C/a>, and was implementing the micropub protocol (which I will blog about at a later time), I decided that it was at the time to host the images on a platform that was meant to do that. I looked at a few storage providers such as cloudinary and S3 based object storage and landed on \u003Ca href=\"https://storj.io/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Storj.io\u003C/a>, mostly because of the generous free tier, which should suffice for this little blog for quite a while.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>One thing that bothered me slightly was that all storage providers I looked at charge for traffic. It's not the fact that it's an additional expense (if your not in the free tier anymore) that bothers me, but the fact that I don't have any control over how much this will cost me. In all likelihood this will never cost me anything since this blog has not much traffic, but if a post were to go viral (one can dream...), this could result in a surprise bill at the end of the month.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>To help with the traffic costs I decided to try to use the free CDN functionality of Cloudflare to reduce the traffic to Storj. In this blog post I will describe how I did that.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2>Is this the right solution for you?\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>If you are in a similar situation as me, and just want to have somewhere to host your images for a personal website or to share images or screenshots as links while still having control over all your data, this could be a good solution.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>If you want to build a robust image pipeline with resizing and image optimization, or you are building an enterprise website this is probably not the right way. You should take a look at cloudinary or one of the big cloud providers.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2>Prerequisites\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>To use Cloudflare as a CDN, you need to have Cloudflare setup as your DNS host for the domain you want to serve the images from. Even if you just want to use a subdomain like \u003Ccode>media.example.com\u003C/code>, the whole \u003Ccode>example.com\u003C/code> domain needs to be on cloudflare. For me this was not much of an issue, I followed the instructions from cloudflare and pointed the nameserver of my domain to cloudflare. Although I did have an issue during the migration, which resulted in my website being down for two hours. But I'm pretty sure this was caused by my previous nameserver provider.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2>Setting up Storj &#x26; Cloudflare\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>I assume you already have an account at \u003Ca href=\"https://storj.io/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">storj.io\u003C/a>. The next step is creating a bucket for your images. A bucket is just a place for your files and folders to live in storj, just like in any other S3 compatible storage provider. (Actually there are no folders in storj and other S3 services, the folders are just prefixes of the filenames). When creating a bucket, make sure you save the passphrase securely, such as in your password manager. Whenever storj asks you for the passphrase, make sure you don't let storj generate a new one! Every new passphrase will create access to a new bucket.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The next step is \u003Ca href=\"https://docs.storj.io/dcs/downloads/download-uplink-cli\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">installing the uplink cli\u003C/a>. Follow the quick start tutorial to \u003Ca href=\"https://docs.storj.io/dcs/getting-started/quickstart-uplink-cli/uploading-your-first-object\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">get an access grant\u003C/a>. Remember to use the same passphrase from above. Now follow the next quickstart tutorial to \u003Ca href=\"https://docs.storj.io/dcs/getting-started/quickstart-uplink-cli/uploading-your-first-object/set-up-uplink-cli\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">add the bucket to the uplink cli\u003C/a>. The file \u003Ccode>accessgrant.txt\u003C/code> in the tutorial only contains the access-grant string that you got from the last step.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Finally we want to share the bucket so the images can be accessed from the web. For this you can run the following command:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cpre>\u003Ccode class=\"language-sh\">uplink share --dns &#x3C;domain> sj://&#x3C;bucket>/&#x3C;prefix> --not-after=none\n\u003C/code>\u003C/pre>\n\u003Cp>Replace \u003Ccode>&#x3C;domain>\u003C/code> with the domain you want to serve the images from. In my case I use \u003Ccode>media.tiim.ch\u003C/code>. Then replace \u003Ccode>&#x3C;bucket>\u003C/code> with the name of your bucket and \u003Ccode>&#x3C;prefix>\u003C/code> with the prefix.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>As mentioned above, you can think of a prefix as a folder. If you use for example \u003Ccode>media-site1\u003C/code> as a prefix, then every file in the \"folder\" \u003Ccode>media-site1\u003C/code> will be shared. This means you can use multiple prefixes to serve files for multiple websites in the same bucket.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>You will get the following output:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cpre>\u003Ccode>[...]\n=========== DNS INFO =====================================================================\nRemember to update the $ORIGIN with your domain name. You may also change the $TTL.\n$ORIGIN example.com.\n$TTL    3600\nmedia.example.com           IN      CNAME   link.storjshare.io.\ntxt-media.example.com       IN      TXT     storj-root:mybucket/myprefix\ntxt-media.example.com       IN      TXT     storj-access:totallyrandomstringofnonsens\n\u003C/code>\u003C/pre>\n\u003Cp>Create the DNS entries in Cloudflare with the values printed in the last three lines. Make sure you enable the proxy setting when entering the CNAME entry to enable Cloudflares CDN service.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And that's it. All files you put in the bucket with the correct prefix are now available under your domain! :)\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>If this blog post helped you, or you have some issues or thoughts on this, leave a comment via the comment box below or via webmention.\u003C/p>","blog/2022-12-storj-cloudflare-image-hosting","6d5a964d-328e-43d7-9189-40280b012074",["Date","2022-12-03T13:37:33.000Z"],[8],null,"Hosting Images with Storj and Cloudflare",true,"Learn how to setup affordable image hosting for your personal website with Storj.io and Cloudflare.","https://media.tiim.ch/d280fad4-632a-4b5a-b6b2-6a5c0026b61c.jpg","Image generated by Dall-E: travel postcards scattered on grass, top down view, photoreal",[15,16,17,18],"CDN","IndieWeb","Cloudflare","Storj","\u003Cp>[!WARNING] Update May 2024\nStorj has quietly removed their free plan and seems to hold all images on my website for ransom until I\npay for the premium plan.

That is when I first learned about the wonderful world of the \u003Ca href=\"https://indieweb.org/why\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">IndieWeb\u003C/a>. It took me a while to read through some of the concepts of the IndieWeb like webmentions, IndieAuth, microformats and all the other standards, but the more I found out about it the more I wanted to play around with it. And what better place to try out new technology than on a personal website?\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2>The IndieWeb\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>I will start with a brief introduction for the uninitiated. If you have already heard about the IndieWeb, feel free to skip to the next section.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The IndieWeb is a collection of standards, intending to make the web social, without the user giving up ownership of their data. While on social media platforms (or as called in IndieWeb terms: silos) you can easily communicate with others, you are always subject to the whims of those platforms.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The IndieWeb wants to solve this by defining standards that, once implemented in a website, allow it to communicate with other websites that are also part of the IndieWeb.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The most important concept of the IndieWeb is, you have control over your data. All of your shared data lives on a domain you control.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Some of the standards in the IndieWeb include:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>Microformats2: a way to add structured data to the HTML source code of a website so machines can interpret the data.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Webmentions: a simple communication protocol between websites. It can be used to show comments, likes, bookmarks and more on one website, while the data stays on another website.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>IndieAuth, an OAuth2-based way to log in using only your domain name.\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Ch2>The implementation on my website\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>As explained in my earlier post \u003Ca href=\"https://tiim.ch/blog/2022-07-12-first-go-project-commenting-api\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">First Go Project: A Jam-stack Commenting API\u003C/a>, my website is a statically built SvelteKit app hosted on GitHub Pages. This means the most important part of the IndieWeb is already implemented: I own this domain and post my content here.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3>Making the website machine-readable with Microformats\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>As mentioned above, the microformats2 standard allows websites to encode data about the page in a machine-readable format. This is accomplished by annotating HTML elements with some predefined class names. For example, the microformat for a blog post, note and other content is called \u003Ca href=\"http://microformats.org/wiki/h-entry\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">h-entry\u003C/a>. By adding the \u003Ccode>h-entry\u003C/code> class to a div, its content is marked as belonging to that post. Children of this div can in turn have other microformat elements such as \u003Ccode>p-name\u003C/code>, \u003Ccode>p-author\u003C/code> or \u003Ccode>dt-published\u003C/code>.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>While these CSS classes make the data machine-interpretable, the same data is still available to the user. There is no duplication like for example the meta tags in OpenGraph.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Since my page is a custom SvelteKit app, it was easy enough to add the CSS classes to the right places. I even took the opportunity to add some more information to the pages, like the author card you see if you scroll to the bottom of this post.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3>Accepting comments and other interactions via Webmentions\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>The standard I wanted to play around with the most are webmentions. A webmention is a sort of notification sent from one website A to another website B, telling B that A has a page linking to it.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In the IndieWeb all types of interactions are just web pages. The microformats2 specification for example allows replies, quotes, likes, bookmarks and many other types of interactions. The receiver of the webmention is free to extract any relevant information from the sender page and might display it, for example as a comment.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Since I already have a \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/Tiim/IndieGo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">small custom service\u003C/a> running for the comment section on this site, I decided to add support to it for receiving webmentions. I refactored the comment system quite a bit to make it more modular and extendable, to allow me to add webmentions\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It currently supports all the required and some optional features for receiving webmentions: The first thing it does is validate the mention. A mention is only valid if the source and target URLs are valid and if the page from the source URL links to the target URL. The next step is extracting some microformat content from the source URL and saving it to the database.\nI found some things unexpectedly tricky to implement: for example, a repeated webmention with the same source URL should update the previously saved webmention if the link to the target page is still there, but delete the webmention if the link was removed.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I have tested my webmentions implementation using \u003Ca href=\"https://webmention.rocks\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">webmention.rocks\u003C/a>, but I would appreciate it if you left me a mention as well 😃\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3>Publishing short-form content such as replies, likes and bookmarks: A notes post type\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>The next thing I wanted to add to my website was sending webmentions. But before I implemented that, I wanted a way to publish short content without spamming my blog feed. For this, I created a new post type called \u003Ca href=\"https://tiim.ch/mf2\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">notes\u003C/a>. The list of notes lives on the /mf2 page because I plan to mostly use it to publish notes that contain microformats2 classes such as replies and likes. Another reason I didn't want to make it accessible as the /notes page is that I plan to publish my Zettelkasten notes eventually, but this is a story for another post.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I also used the opportunity to add an RSS feed for all my posts, pages, projects, and notes: \u003Ca href=\"https://tiim.ch/full-rss.xml\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">full-rss.xml\u003C/a>. I do not recommend you subscribe to it unless you are curious about all changes to the content on my website.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3>Notifying referenced websites: Sending Webmentions\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Sending webmentions was easy compared to receiving webmentions:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>On a regular interval (and on page builds), the server loads the full RSS feed and checks what items have a newer timestamp than the last time. It then extracts a list of all URLs from that feed item and loads the list of URLs that it extracted last time. Then a webmention is sent to all the URLs.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Luckily I did not have to implement any of this myself apart from some glue code to fit it together: I used the library \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/go-co-op/gocron\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">gocron\u003C/a> for scheduling the regular intervals, \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/mmcdole/gofeed\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">gofeed\u003C/a> for parsing the RSS feed and \u003Ca href=\"https://willnorris.com/go/webmention\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">webmention\u003C/a> for extracting links and sending webmentions.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3>In the future: IndieAuth\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>The next thing on my roadmap is implementing IndieAuth. Although not because I have a real use case for it, but because I'm interested in OAuth, the underlying standard, and this seems like a good opportunity to get a deeper understanding of the protocol.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Although, before I start implementing the next things, I should probably focus on writing blog posts first. There is no use in the most advanced blogging system if I can't be bothered to write anything.\u003C/p>\u003Cdiv class=\"mf2\">\u003Cblockquote class=\"syndication\">This post is also on \u003Cul>\u003Cli>\u003Ca class=\"u-syndication\" href=\"https://news.indieweb.org/en\">news.indieweb.org\u003C/a>\u003C/li>\u003C/ul>\u003C/blockquote>\u003C/div>\n","blog/2022-12-indiewebifying-my-website-part-1","3b342241-c414-4670-bd22-03e13d6531b7",["Date","2022-11-12T10:55:14.000Z"],[8],"IndieWebifying my Website Part 1 - Microformats and Webmentions",["Date","2022-12-03T20:56:54.000Z"],"This site now supports sending and receiving webmentions and surfacing structured data using microformats2.","https://i.imgur.com/FpgIBxI.jpg",[16,52,53,54,55,56],"Webmentions","mf2","tiim.ch","go","indiego",[58],"https://news.indieweb.org/en","\u003Cp>A few weeks ago, I stumbled on one of \u003Ca href=\"https://www.jvt.me/posts/2019/08/21/rsvp-from-your-website/\">Jamie Tanna's blog posts about microformats2\u003C/a> by accident.
