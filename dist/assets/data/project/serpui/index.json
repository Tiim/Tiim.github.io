But when vision degrades so does the ability to gather and synthesize information from online. SerpUI is free search engine tool that simplifies the Google search engine interface by minimizing the userspace and reducing the learning curve. </p>\n<h3 id=\"try-it-out-here\"><a href=\"#try-it-out-here\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"heading-anchor\"></span></a>Try it out <a href=\"https://serpui-heroku.herokuapp.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">here</a></h3>\n<h2 id=\"how-does-it-work\"><a href=\"#how-does-it-work\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"heading-anchor\"></span></a>How does it work</h2>\n<p>The user has two controller options their keyboard or the Nintendo JoyCon controller connected via Bluetooth. The JoyCon controls are easy to learn and provide a comfortable browsing experience. The user starts by recording themselves describing what they would like to search. With the power of Google Cloud Services a real-time speech-to-text algorithm translates that to text where the user can verify their input. The background changes to a vibrant blue to appeal to users with strong visual impairment, a loud <strong><em>DING</em></strong> sound is also produced.</p>\n<figure class=\"figure\">\n    <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theguymeyer/guymeyer_CV/master/res/serpui/serpui_homepage.png\" alt=\"pacemaker testing station setup\" width=\"48%\" style=\"float: middle;\"/>\n    <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theguymeyer/guymeyer_CV/master/res/serpui/serpui_recording.png\" alt=\"pacemaker testing station setup\" width=\"48%\" style=\"float: middle;\"/>\n    <figcaption class=\"caption\">Recording a query on the SerpUI Homepage (src: Guy Meyer)</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure>\n    <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theguymeyer/guymeyer_CV/master/res/serpui/serpui_serp_hello.png\" alt=\"pacemaker testing station setup\" width=\"48%\" style=\"float: middle;\"/>\n    <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theguymeyer/guymeyer_CV/master/res/serpui/serpui_youtube.png\" alt=\"pacemaker testing station setup\" width=\"48%\" style=\"float: middle;\"/>\n    <figcaption class=\"caption\">Moving around in the SerpUI Results Page (src: Guy Meyer)</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p><strong>SerpUI also supports YouTube and will play the videos auto-magically!</strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"the-minimized-userspace\"><a href=\"#the-minimized-userspace\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"heading-anchor\"></span></a>The Minimized Userspace</h2>\n<p>Once submitted they are redirected to SerpUI (Search Engine Results Page User Interface). On the results page the content is identical to Google's results page just presented differently, high contrast, focused and with interactive audio feedback. Rows represent result ranking, and columns categorize the result's content (ie. Title, Snippet, Page Content, Link). At any given moment the user can only select one of seven instructions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Down Arrow => Next Search Result</li>\n<li>Up Arrow => Previous Search Result</li>\n<li>Right Arrow => Next Result Content</li>\n<li>Left Arrow => Previous Result Content</li>\n<li>SHIFT => Read Current Content</li>\n<li>CTRL => Stop Text to Speech</li>\n<li>ESC => Go To Homepage</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This environment is surrounded with virtual borders that <strong><em>DING</em></strong> when the user hits them. This provides information on the location of the user. </p>\n<h2 id=\"backend\"><a href=\"#backend\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"heading-anchor\"></span></a>Backend</h2>\n<p>A NodeJS server with Express.
