## Overview

Let the wheelbarrow do the work! This electrical wheelbarrow packs enough power to move heavy loads on-site. Equipped with two recharagable 19V batteries the battery will easily last a long day of work. This project was commissioned by Toolway Industries. Here are some pictures of the design.

## Prototyping

Powered with a strong DC motor in the wheel all the user needs to do is lightly pull on the throttle. All coupling and fittings were prototyped with 3D printing in-house and designed as custom components to form an initial assembly.
