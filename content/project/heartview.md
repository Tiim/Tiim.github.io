## Overview

Robotics labs are a great way for students at university to gain practical experience. Unfortunately many labs do not allow the students to feel engaged during development. 

Over the last few years a small team at McMaster have been developing a pacemaker project that aims to bring encitement back to the classroom.

## Remote Learning

The pacemaker project ([More Here...](http://sqrl.mcmaster.ca/pacemaker.htm)) is now a reliable method for engaging third year mechatronics students. So when suddenly hit by the COVID pandemic I worked hard to transition the project to be online and ready for September 2020.
