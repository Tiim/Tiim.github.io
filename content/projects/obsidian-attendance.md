A plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). It helps you to keep attendance of your class, meeting, or any other occasion directly inside your notes.

I built this plugin to help me keep all my coaching related information right in my obsidian vault. The plugin is inspired by the [Obsidian Dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview) plugin, and therefore very flexible and customisable.
