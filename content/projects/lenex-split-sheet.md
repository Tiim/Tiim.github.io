Generate useful splits sheets directly from your [Lenex](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenex) _(.lxf, .lef)_ file that you used to sign up the athletes for a meet.

The split sheet creator is a quick and easy way to create a split sheet from your Lenex sign-up file.
The split sheet creator does not send your Lenex file to any servers. The file is opened directly in your browser and never leaves your computer!

I built this web app using my [lenex javascript library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/js-lenex).

## What is a split sheet?

Swim coaches often write down the times of athletes after some fractions of a race (splits). Usually those splits are recorded every lap or every second lap.
