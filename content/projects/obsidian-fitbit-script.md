If you use [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) to track your daily activity and wear a fitbit, this script is for you! This is a user script for the [Templater](https://silentvoid13.github.io/Templater/) Obsidian plugin. The script will connect to the fitbit API to fetch all your activity for a given day and format it as markdown.
