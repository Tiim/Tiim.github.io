I like to 3d scan and model as a hobby. To keep me motivated, I decided to put the models for sale on cgTrader.

![Example of a 3D scanned model: A pile of clothes on the floor](https://img2.cgtrader.com/items/3180107/fd6e03d4a5/pile-of-clothes-on-the-ground-3d-scanned-3d-model-low-poly-obj-fbx-blend-fbm.jpg)

For 3D modeling I use the open source tool [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) and for 3D scanning my software of choice is [Reality Capture](https://www.capturingreality.com/).
