TemKit makes it easy to organize any kind of teams. Built for sport clubs, coaches, youth groups and more. TeamKit supports taking attendance, planning practices or events and keeping track of what coaches/teachers are responsible for which team.

I built TeamKit because the swim club I am a part of needed an easy way for coaches to have an overview of their teams, handle attendance and track their own hours (not implemented yet). I tried a bunch of existing apps and services, but all of them were either too clunky for us or required the team members to sign up as well. This was a dealbreaker for us because we have a bunch of kids teams which are too young to sign up to websites, and because many of the parents are not very tech literate.

With TeamKit a coach can quickly add new team members to a team, create new members directly in the event view (useful for example a person that just wants to try out) without having to add more details than a name.

In the latest update, TeamKit now allows users to create notes on events. This is useful for planning, writing quick notes for an event or a practice session and for sharing information with other coaches.

If you are interested, TeamKit is currenlty free while it is still in beta.
