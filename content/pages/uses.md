## Apps & Coding

- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is my preferred code editor. I have tried many others, including Atom and IntelliJ IDEA, but VS Code looks and feels the most intuitive to me.

\* I use the [Horizon Dark VSCode Theme](https://horizontheme.netlify.app/), which is also the color scheme my website is based on.

\* The [Live Share](https://code.visualstudio.com/learn/collaboration/live-share) plugin quickly turned into one of my favourite VSCode plugins, it makes remotely pairing on a project a breeze.

- [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) is the first note taking tool I actually use on a regular basis. I really enjoy the flexibility of it, especially regarding the quickly growing plugin ecosystem.
