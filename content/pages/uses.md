description: List of software and gear I use on a regular basis.

This page lists all of the gear and tools I use on a daily basis. This page is inspired by [@wesbos]'s [uses.tech](https://uses.tech/) page.

## Software

### Editor and Terminal

- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
  This is my preferred code editor. I have tried many others, including Atom and IntelliJ IDEA, but VS Code looks and feels the most intuitive to me and has support for virtually every language out there.
  - I use the [Horizon Dark VSCode Theme](https://horizontheme.netlify.app/), which is also the colour scheme my website is based on.
  - The [Live Share](https://code.visualstudio.com/learn/collaboration/live-share) plugin quickly turned into one of my favourite VSCode plugins, it makes remote pairing on a project a breeze.
- My favourite monospace font is currently [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode).
- I use the new [Windows Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal) as my main terminal. I like it because it lets me easily switch between WSL2 and Powershell or CMD, it supports custom font, and it just looks really nice.

### Note Taking

- [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) is the first note taking tool I actually use on a regular basis. I really enjoy the flexibility of it, especially regarding the quickly growing plugin ecosystem. A few of my favourite plugins are in no particular order:
  - [Obsidian Dataview](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/)
  - [Obsidian Git](https://github.com/denolehov/obsidian-git)
  - [Obsidian RSS](https://github.com/joethei/obsidian-rss)
  - [Obsidian Tasks](https://schemar.github.io/obsidian-tasks/)
  - [Obsidian Templater](https://silentvoid13.github.io/Templater/)

### Other Apps

- [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/de/firefox/new/) has been my default browser for many years now. I switched back to it after using chrome because I agree with its focus on privacy.
- Mozilla Thunderbird, I am grudgingly using thunderbird as my email program because I have not found anything better yet. If you know of a better (preferably open source) alternative that allows an unlimited number of email addresses then shoot me a message.
- I heavily rely on [FancyZones](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/fancyzones) of Windows PowerToys to arrange my windows in a tiled-ish way.

## Tech Stack

- [Svelte / Svelte kit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) is currently my favourite web framework. I previously used [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/) but I like the pragmatic way of svelte the most so far.
- [Hasura](https://hasura.io/) makes building web applications a breeze. It saves me from reimplementing the same fundamental things such as the GraphQL API, authorisation and admin dashboard for every project.
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) in combination with [Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/) makes hosting multiple applications on the same server a breeze.

## Gear

### PC Gear

- [Blue Snowball](https://www.bluemic.com/en-us/products/snowball/) is the USB microphone I am currently using. I got it a long time ago when it was all the rage, and it was a huge upgrade from my cheap headset microphone. I would not buy it today but it is more than good enough for video conferencing.
- Logitech c920 is my reliable webcam. I got it a year before the pandemic (thankfully!) and I am quite happy with it.
- [Ultimate Hacking Keyboard](https://ultimatehackingkeyboard.com/) This is my first real mechanical keyboard. I really like the split keyboard layout which makes typing much more ergonomic in my opinion. I use MX Brown switches.
- The Logitech MX Master 3 mouse is the newest addition to my gear, and the first wireless mouse I own. I was sceptical about the battery duration at first but it really is not an issue for me.
- Wacom Intuos Pen & Touch small was the drawing tablet I purchased a long time ago when I tried to get into drawing. Nowadays I use it mostly for writing on virtual whiteboards.

### Multimedia Gear

- I take pictures with my trusty **Panasonic Lumix G7**. I really love this camera, it is still very good for the price and even log lenses are not bulky at all. Check out some of my pictures on my [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/people/152309161@N02/).
