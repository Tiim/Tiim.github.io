This page lists most of the gear and tools I use on a daily basis. This page is inspired by [@wesbos](https://wesbos.com)' [uses.tech](https://uses.tech/) page.

## Software

### Editor and Terminal

- [NeoVim](https://neovim.io/),
  I have recently switched to neovim from vscode. I planned to just give vim a spin for a few weeks, but somehow I don't seem to be able to go back ðŸ¤”.
- I use the [Nightfox.nvim](https://github.com/EdenEast/nightfox.nvim) theme. Before switching to neovim, I used the excelent [Beyond the Horizon Dark VSCode Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shaneyu.beyond-the-horizon-theme-vscode), which is based on the [Horizon Dark](https://horizontheme.netlify.app/) colour scheme, which I kind of miss. This website uses this colour scheme too.
- My favourite monospace font is currently [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode), which I use in the terminal, and therefore in the editor as well.
- I use the [Windows Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal) as my main terminal. I like it because it lets me easily switch between WSL2 and Powershell or CMD, it supports custom font, and it just looks really nice.

### Note Taking

- [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) is the first note taking tool I actually use on a regular basis. I really enjoy the flexibility of it, especially regarding the quickly growing plugin ecosystem. A few of my favourite plugins are in no particular order:
  - [Obsidian Templater](https://silentvoid13.github.io/Templater/)
  - [Obsidian Dataview](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/)
  - [Obsidian Git](https://github.com/denolehov/obsidian-git)

### Other Apps

- [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/de/firefox/new/) has been my default browser for many years now. I switched back to it after using chrome because I agree with its focus on privacy.
- Mozilla Thunderbird, I used to grudgingly use thunderbird as my email program because I have not found anything better yet. However, in the recent months the changes to thunderbird make it way more enjoyable to use. I still miss a way to sync my settings and RSS feeds between my laptop and my desktop computer though.
- I heavily rely on [FancyZones](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/fancyzones) of Windows PowerToys to arrange my windows in a tiled-ish way.
- Microsoft To Do, I have recently been looking for a good and simple program to keep all my tasks. Microsoft To Do seems to fit this quite well and looks stunning.
- Trello, just the easiest way to keep track of projects that consist of multiple tasks. I have a trello board for most of my side projects, as well as for private projects.

## Tech Stack

- [Svelte / Svelte kit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) is currently my favourite frontend web framework for highly dynamic content. I previously used [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/) but I like the pragmatic way of svelte the most so far.
- [Hasura](https://hasura.io/) makes building web applications a breeze. It saves me from reimplementing the same fundamental things such as the GraphQL API, authorisation and admin dashboard for every project.
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) in combination with [Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/) makes hosting multiple applications on the same server a breeze.
- For future projects that have a server side component, I am strongly considering using [htmx](https://htmx.org/) for the frontend.

## Gear

### PC Gear

- [Tascam TM-80](https://www.tascam.eu/en/tm-80) is the XLR microphone I am currently using. I got it quite recently after I got fed up with my ugly USB microphone.
- As an audio interface I use the minimalist [Audient evo 4](https://evo.audio/products/audio-interfaces/evo-4/overview/).
- Logitech c920 is my reliable webcam. I got it a year before the pandemic (thankfully!) and I am quite happy with it.
- At work I use the [Ultimate Hacking Keyboard](https://ultimatehackingkeyboard.com/) This is my first real mechanical keyboard. I really like the split keyboard layout which makes typing much more ergonomic in my opinion. I use MX Brown switches.
- At home I recently got the [Keychron K8 Pro] keyboard with Gateron G Pro Brown switches. I really love the sound and the feel of this keyboard.
- The Logitech MX Master 3 mouse is the newest addition to my gear, and the first wireless mouse I own. I was sceptical about the battery duration at first but it really is not an issue for me.
- Wacom Intuos Pen & Touch small was the drawing tablet I purchased a long time ago when I tried to get into drawing. Nowadays I use it mostly for writing on virtual whiteboards.

### Multimedia Gear

- I take pictures with my trusty **Panasonic Lumix G7**. I really love this camera, it is still very good for the price and even log lenses are not bulky at all. Check out some of my pictures on my [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/people/152309161@N02/).
