I am planning to publish the list of blogs I subscribe to here in the future. But I still have not figured out how
to automatically export the list of feeds from Mozilla Thunderbird and import it here. Until then, this page consists of
a manual list of pages that I like.

## Links

- [Ye Olde Blogroll](https://blogroll.org/), a human curated list of personal blogs.
- [uses.tech](https://uses.tech/), a list of personal websites that have a [`/uses`](/uses) page.
- [changelog.com/news](https://changelog.com/news), curated developer news as a podcast and as a newsletter. Unfortunately not available a RSS subscribable blog post.

_You have some suggestions for other cool or useful websites or blogs? [Let me know](/contact)._
