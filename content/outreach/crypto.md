## Overview

In the height of cryptocurrency only a handful of us were actively mining. This lecture, "Cryptocurrency and the Blockchain Revolution" gave an opportunity for students and staff around the university to learn about the fundamentals of cryptocurrency and what blockchain is all about.

Great energy, lots of curiousity and a whole lot of fun! Thanks everyone for coming!

Here's some pictures from the event...
