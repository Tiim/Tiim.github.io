## Overview

As the only researcher in our department focused on software for the visually impaired it was important to me to recruit others to join the project. I worked pro-bono with a three engineering student teams interested in developing applications for the blind. Their projects focused on two sectors of navigation; physical and cyber.

Physical navigation relates to tools utilized when walking, moving or traversing a physical space. While cyber centers around navigation of virtual world (see SerpUI for more). The cyber navigation project related to virtual navigation of books... pretty cool in my opinion :)


## Guide Day

@icon-info-circle
A day for engineering students to learn about blindness.

In order to connect students with their end-user I felt it was necessary to recruit field experts and blind individuals to participate in activities and Q&A with the students. We had a day full of O&M (mobility) drills and a panel for discussion.

The lessons learned by our students filled them motivation and a new perspective on how to approach these unique engineering problems.

Thank you Valerie Kitazaki, Ka Li, and Rachel (from W. Ross) for taking your time to share your experiences with our students!
