However, in the recent months the changes to thunderbird make it way more enjoyable to use. I still miss a way to sync my settings and RSS feeds between my laptop and my desktop computer though.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>I heavily rely on \u003Ca href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/fancyzones\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">FancyZones\u003C/a> of Windows PowerToys to arrange my windows in a tiled-ish way.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Microsoft To Do, I have recently been looking for a good and simple program to keep all my tasks.
