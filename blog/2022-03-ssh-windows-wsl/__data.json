This can be done with the PowerShell command:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cpre>\u003Ccode class=\"language-PowerShell\">New-ItemProperty -Path \"HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\OpenSSH\" -Name DefaultShell -Value \"C:\\WINDOWS\\System32\\bash.exe\" -PropertyType String -Force\n\u003C/code>\u003C/pre>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Note\u003C/strong>: even though the shell is running on the Linux side, the SSH server is still on windows. This means you have to use to windows username to log in, and the SCP command copies files relative to the user directory on windows.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2>Enable Key-based Authentication (non-Admin User)\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Note\u003C/strong>: If the user account has Admin permissions, read the next chapter, otherwise continue reading.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Create the folder \u003Ccode>.ssh\u003C/code> in the users home directory on windows: (e.g. \u003Ccode>C:\\Users\\&#x3C;username>\\.ssh\u003C/code>).

A second requirement is that it is only accessible to Administrator users, to prevent a normal user from gaining admin permissions.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>To create the file start PowerShell as administrator and run the following command.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cpre>\u003Ccode class=\"language-PowerShell\">New-Item -Path $env:programdata\\ssh\\administrators_authorized_keys\n\u003C/code>\u003C/pre>\n\u003Cp>This will create the file with the correct permissions. Now open the file and paste your public key into it. The public key should be located at \u003Ccode>~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub\u003C/code>. If a key is already present, paste your key on a new line.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2>Verifying everything works\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Verify that you can SSH into your machine by running the following inside WSL:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cpre>\u003Ccode class=\"language-sh\">IP=$(cat /etc/resolv.conf | grep nameserver | cut -d \" \" -f2) # get the windows host ip address\nssh &#x3C;user>@$IP\n\u003C/code>\u003C/pre>\n\u003Cp>Or from PowerShell and cmd:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cpre>\u003Ccode class=\"language-PowerShell\">ssh &#x3C;user>@localhost\n\u003C/code>\u003C/pre>\n\u003Ch2>Drawbacks\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>There are some drawbacks to this approach. If you rely on some programs or scripts to work over SSH, this might not be the method for you. Most scripts expect a unix machine on the other end, or if they expect a windows machine they will most likely not be configured to deal with WSL.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>If you however just want to connect to your pc to copy some files or change some settings this approach is perfectly fine.\u003C/p>","blog/2022-03-ssh-windows-wsl","03b5a86c-5f4d-4086-9f5f-e1e46b4bcf58","How to set up an SSH Server on Windows with WSL",true,["Date","2022-03-02T00:00:00.000Z"],"It can be very helpful to be able to connect to your laptop or desktop PC from anywhere using SSH.
