In the last while I\nhave learned a lot about Kubernetes, and am strongly considering switching my \"simple\" hosting setup for a more complex Kubernetes cluster. So before I do that I want\nto write down what my current setup looks like.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2>Setup\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"https://media.tiim.ch/0887e318-9359-4753-abaf-49ae7c26dfcd.webp\" alt=\"\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>As mentioned, everything is hosted in docker containers. Generally, I try to keep everything in docker-compose, since this allows me to specify the settings of the container once, and easily modify it later.\nTo have multiple services available on port 80 and 443, I use the Traeffik (Software) reverse proxy. I use Traefik without a config file, meaning it pulls the routes and rules directly from the labels of the\nrunning containers on the VPS. This makes it easy to launch a new service and have its reverse proxy config directly in the docker-compose file.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Since many services use a database, and Postgres seems to be supported by many open-source projects, I decided to have a central Postgres instance running in a docker container. This allows me to\nback it up with a simple cron job in a single place. If a service does not support Postgres, I specify its database directly in the docker-compose file.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Almost all services use disk access for either config, local files, or similar. I do have a docker folder that is the root of all locally stored files.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2>OS Setup\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>When I first started, I configured everything by hand, and documented how, why, and what I did. However I was not happy with this, I could not test it out and it was prone to errors.\nTherefore, I decided to use Ansible to set up the server and install all dependencies.\nThis worked well, so well that I decided that Ansible was good enough to use to operate the entire pipeline, even to automate the deployment of the services.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2>Deployment\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>I do have an ansible role per service, with its configuration (mostly) as ansible YAML files, and the docker-compose files and other config files as ansible templates. This worked great, with a single ansible-playbook command I can\nmake sure everything is running and has the right config.\nFor most services, I even built logic to make sure that when the docker-compose file or a config file changes, the container is restarted.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2>The good parts\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>I am quite happy with this system in general. Everything runs stable, backups are easy and automated, and deployments for services that are already configured are a breeze.\nI can keep the whole \"description\" of what is running in a single git repo, and make changes by editing config files.\nThis is a huge step up from manually deploying and keeping track of what docker commands to use for what service.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2>The not so good parts\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Recently I noticed some pain points.\u003C/p>\n\u003Col>\n\u003Cli>If I want to deploy a service twice for two domain names, I have to create a copy of the role. This unfortunately leads to duplicated \"code\" which can (and does) lead to configuration drift.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>I have to code things myself that already exist. For example, restarting a container when a config value changes. For most services this is implemented, but not everywhere, and also not for all possible things that can be changed.

It was really active, not only consisting of newcomers to the language but also veterans. When I joined this forum in my teens I quickly went from just asking beginner questions, to enjoying helping other beginners, that asked the same questions as I did previously. I got better at the language, learned new programming concepts all through reading posts, helped others, and shared my projects on this forum.

Again, the community relied heavily on a forum for communications. This time it was used for players to engage in \"out of character\" communication, as well as a way to simulate a metaphorical bullet board in the game town square where characters could leave notes for each other.\nSince the game was closely inspired by TTRPGs like D&#x26;D, the role-playing part was more important than the in-game mechanics. The forum allowed characters to interact with each other that were not online at the same time. Again, I got really invested in this community, even going so far as joining other guild-specific forums.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I eventually moved on from both of those amazing communities, because my interests changed. I left the AutoHotkey community because I started to get more involved with other programming languages, and I left the Illarion community because I (with the support of my parents) was looking for a less time-intensive game. Unfortunately, I never happened to find another online community like those two ever again...\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Sometime later I joined Reddit and was amazed. It felt like a place where all communities come together on a single site. No need to check on multiple websites for new posts, everything neatly together in a single website, accessible on a single (third party) app. I remember wondering why people were still using forums when Reddit was so much simpler.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Jumping to the present and I realize that I was wrong. Even though I am subscribed to a bunch of communities on Reddit, I barely comment on any posts and posted even less. While I am a community member on record, I do not feel like one. The wealth of communities, as well as the incentive to go on the front page to see the most popular posts of the whole site, made me want to open Reddit, but it did not give me the feeling of belonging. I rather felt like a spectator that from time to time gathers the courage to shout his own ideas into the ether.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>Side note: Discord comes much closer to the feeling of community. However, the nature of chat makes the interactions fleeting, being in a chat room with a few hundred other people, where every message is just a few sentences at most does not lead to the same connections. No one expects their message to be read again after a few days.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>Now the company behind Reddit started to lose the goodwill of the users. While I don't think Reddit will die anytime soon, I think there are a lot of people looking for alternatives. And the best alternative to the website that killed forums is... forums.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>While forums largely still work the same as they did 15 years ago, there have been developments that might make them more feasible for our desire to have everything accessible on a single site or on a single app. Last time a social media company, Twitter, annoyed its user base, the fediverse, and more specifically Mastodon, started to go more mainstream. This time I hope there will be other projects that profit. I have heard people mentioning the projects Kbin and Lemmy, both forum-like platforms that implement the ActivityPub specification. Same as Mastodon, this means users are able to interact with users on other instances. Even further, this should also allow users of any federated social network, such as Mastodon, to post and comment on any federated forum. Even established forum software such as \u003Ca href=\"https://community.nodebb.org/topic/17117/what-s-next-after-v3/18\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Flarum\u003C/a> and \u003Ca href=\"https://community.nodebb.org/topic/17117/what-s-next-after-v3/18\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">nodeBB\u003C/a> are considering adding federation support.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I really hope that forums make a comeback, not only because of the nostalgia but also because to me it feels like a more sustainable way to build a community. And now with the possibility to federate via the fediverse, a forum doesn't have to be a walled garden of members any more. In the end, most importantly I hope people are still finding communities they can be as passionate about as I was, without any corporate overlords trying to keep their eyeballs on ads as long as possible.\u003C/p>","blog/2023-06-16-forums","624afba6-2962-4710-9bc7-686702cc9b55",["Date","2023-06-16T18:56:56.000Z"],["Date","2023-06-16T15:09:15.488Z"],[8],"Forums","My experience of using forums in my teens, what changed after I started using reddit and my hopes for internet communities in the future.","https://media.tiim.ch/fe5de393-9773-4eaa-877a-decffbd706b4.webp","Stable Diffusion - bunch people talking to each other, social, speech bubbles, digital art, minimalistic",[51,52,53,54],"forum","fediverse","reddit","activitypub","\u003Cp>My first real programming experience was with a scripting language called \u003Ca href=\"https://www.autohotkey.com/\">AutoHotkey\u003C/a>.

This subcommand will either register a new trigger or replace it if one with the same name already exists.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>\u003Ccode>name\u003C/code> - This argument is self-explanatory, the name of the trigger. In our case I called it \u003Ccode>notify_highlight\u003C/code>, but you could call it whatever you want.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Ccode>hook\u003C/code> - This argument specifies which hook or event the trigger should listen for. WeeChat is built as an event-driven platform, so pretty much anything from mouse movements to IRC messages are handled via events. In this case, we want to trigger on the \u003Ccode>print\u003C/code> event, which is fired every time a new message gets received from IRC.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Ccode>argument\u003C/code> - The argument is needed for some hooks, but not for the \u003Ccode>print\u003C/code> hook, so we are going to ignore that one for now and just set it to an empty string \u003Ccode>''\u003C/code>.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Ccode>condition\u003C/code> - The condition must evaluate to \u003Ccode>true\u003C/code> for the trigger to fire. This is helpful because the \u003Ccode>print\u003C/code> trigger fires for every new message, but we only want to be notified when the new message mentions our nick. The condition for this is \u003Ccode>${tg_highlight}\u003C/code>. You can find the list of variables that you can access with the command \u003Ccode>/trigger monitor\u003C/code>, which prints all variables for every trigger that gets executed.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Ccode>variable-replace\u003C/code> - This took me a while to understand. This command is used to manipulate data and save it to a variable. The syntax is inspired by the sed command. Explaining it fully is out of the scope of this blog post, but you can take a look at the \u003Ca href=\"https://weechat.org/files/doc/devel/weechat_user.en.html#trigger_regex\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">docs\u003C/a>. In our example, we replace the whole content of the variable \u003Ccode>tg_message\u003C/code> with the format string \u003Ccode>${weechat.look.nick_prefix}${tg_prefix_nocolor}${weechat.look.nick_suffix} ${tg_message_nocolor}\u003C/code> which results in a string like \u003Ccode>&#x3C;tiim> Hello world!\u003C/code>.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Ccode>command\u003C/code> - The last argument is the command that gets executed whenever this trigger fires. In our case, we use the \u003Ccode>/execute\u003C/code> command, which starts the wget command which in turn sends a post request to ntfy.sh. Make sure you set the ntfy topic (the part after \u003Ccode>https://ntfy.sh/\u003C/code>) to something private and long enough so that nobody else is going to guess it by accident.\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Cp>Don't forget to subscribe to the ntfy topic on your phone or whatever device you want to receive the notification on.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The possibilities with the trigger plugin are endless, I hope this inspires you to build your own customizations using weechat.\u003C/p>","blog/2023-03-28-weechat-notification-ntfy","ef51e944-86fa-44b0-ab9d-be7f8d8e569a",["Date","2023-03-28T10:05:19.000Z"],["Date","2023-01-15T20:35:40.643Z"],[8],"Weechat Notifications with ntfy.sh","Using the weechat trigger plugin to notify yourself about new private messages and mentions through the ntfy.sh notification service.","https://media.tiim.ch/97833b1d-d602-4d9a-9689-3077e96e45ba.webp","stable diffusion - Anything V3.0 - boy using an old DOS computer, 90s vibes, muted pastel colors, stylized, thick lines, IRC, console",[85,86,87,88],"weechat","ntfy.sh","wget","irc","\u003Cp>In one of my last blog posts I \u003Ca href=\"https://tiim.ch/blog/2023-01-15-weechat-docker\">set up WeeChat in docker\u003C/a>, which works mostly pretty great for me so far.

At first I just embedded them in the website github repository, but this just doesn't feel right. Putting one or two image assets in a codebase is one thing, putting an ever growing list of images in there feels icky to me. For this reason I put the last few cover images of my blog posts on the imgur platform. This is slightly cleaner from a git standpoint but now i have to trust imgur to keep serving these images. Additionally, as I recently discovered, this seems to be against imgurs \u003Ca href=\"https://imgur.com/tos\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">TOS\u003C/a>:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>[...] Also, don't use Imgur to host image libraries you link to from elsewhere, content for your website, advertising, avatars, or anything else that turns us into your content delivery network.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>Finally when I started \u003Ca href=\"https://tiim.ch/blog/2022-12-indiewebifying-my-website-part-1\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">indie-webifying my website\u003C/a>, and was implementing the micropub protocol (which I will blog about at a later time), I decided that it was at the time to host the images on a platform that was meant to do that. I looked at a few storage providers such as cloudinary and S3 based object storage and landed on \u003Ca href=\"https://storj.io/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Storj.io\u003C/a>, mostly because of the generous free tier, which should suffice for this little blog for quite a while.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>One thing that bothered me slightly was that all storage providers I looked at charge for traffic. It's not the fact that it's an additional expense (if your not in the free tier anymore) that bothers me, but the fact that I don't have any control over how much this will cost me. In all likelihood this will never cost me anything since this blog has not much traffic, but if a post were to go viral (one can dream...), this could result in a surprise bill at the end of the month.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>To help with the traffic costs I decided to try to use the free CDN functionality of Cloudflare to reduce the traffic to Storj. In this blog post I will describe how I did that.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2>Is this the right solution for you?\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>If you are in a similar situation as me, and just want to have somewhere to host your images for a personal website or to share images or screenshots as links while still having control over all your data, this could be a good solution.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>If you want to build a robust image pipeline with resizing and image optimization, or you are building an enterprise website this is probably not the right way. You should take a look at cloudinary or one of the big cloud providers.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2>Prerequisites\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>To use Cloudflare as a CDN, you need to have Cloudflare setup as your DNS host for the domain you want to serve the images from. Even if you just want to use a subdomain like \u003Ccode>media.example.com\u003C/code>, the whole \u003Ccode>example.com\u003C/code> domain needs to be on cloudflare. For me this was not much of an issue, I followed the instructions from cloudflare and pointed the nameserver of my domain to cloudflare. Although I did have an issue during the migration, which resulted in my website being down for two hours. But I'm pretty sure this was caused by my previous nameserver provider.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2>Setting up Storj &#x26; Cloudflare\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>I assume you already have an account at \u003Ca href=\"https://storj.io/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">storj.io\u003C/a>. The next step is creating a bucket for your images. A bucket is just a place for your files and folders to live in storj, just like in any other S3 compatible storage provider. (Actually there are no folders in storj and other S3 services, the folders are just prefixes of the filenames). When creating a bucket, make sure you save the passphrase securely, such as in your password manager. Whenever storj asks you for the passphrase, make sure you don't let storj generate a new one! Every new passphrase will create access to a new bucket.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The next step is \u003Ca href=\"https://docs.storj.io/dcs/downloads/download-uplink-cli\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">installing the uplink cli\u003C/a>. Follow the quick start tutorial to \u003Ca href=\"https://docs.storj.io/dcs/getting-started/quickstart-uplink-cli/uploading-your-first-object\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">get an access grant\u003C/a>. Remember to use the same passphrase from above. Now follow the next quickstart tutorial to \u003Ca href=\"https://docs.storj.io/dcs/getting-started/quickstart-uplink-cli/uploading-your-first-object/set-up-uplink-cli\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">add the bucket to the uplink cli\u003C/a>. The file \u003Ccode>accessgrant.txt\u003C/code> in the tutorial only contains the access-grant string that you got from the last step.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Finally we want to share the bucket so the images can be accessed from the web. For this you can run the following command:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cpre>\u003Ccode class=\"language-sh\">uplink share --dns &#x3C;domain> sj://&#x3C;bucket>/&#x3C;prefix> --not-after=none\n\u003C/code>\u003C/pre>\n\u003Cp>Replace \u003Ccode>&#x3C;domain>\u003C/code> with the domain you want to serve the images from. In my case I use \u003Ccode>media.tiim.ch\u003C/code>. Then replace \u003Ccode>&#x3C;bucket>\u003C/code> with the name of your bucket and \u003Ccode>&#x3C;prefix>\u003C/code> with the prefix.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>As mentioned above, you can think of a prefix as a folder. If you use for example \u003Ccode>media-site1\u003C/code> as a prefix, then every file in the \"folder\" \u003Ccode>media-site1\u003C/code> will be shared. This means you can use multiple prefixes to serve files for multiple websites in the same bucket.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>You will get the following output:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cpre>\u003Ccode>[...]\n=========== DNS INFO =====================================================================\nRemember to update the $ORIGIN with your domain name. You may also change the $TTL.\n$ORIGIN example.com.\n$TTL    3600\nmedia.example.com           IN      CNAME   link.storjshare.io.\ntxt-media.example.com       IN      TXT     storj-root:mybucket/myprefix\ntxt-media.example.com       IN      TXT     storj-access:totallyrandomstringofnonsens\n\u003C/code>\u003C/pre>\n\u003Cp>Create the DNS entries in Cloudflare with the values printed in the last three lines.

This means the most important part of the IndieWeb is already implemented: I own this domain and post my content here.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3>Making the website machine-readable with Microformats\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>As mentioned above, the microformats2 standard allows websites to encode data about the page in a machine-readable format. This is accomplished by annotating HTML elements with some predefined class names. For example, the microformat for a blog post, note and other content is called \u003Ca href=\"http://microformats.org/wiki/h-entry\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">h-entry\u003C/a>. By adding the \u003Ccode>h-entry\u003C/code> class to a div, its content is marked as belonging to that post. Children of this div can in turn have other microformat elements such as \u003Ccode>p-name\u003C/code>, \u003Ccode>p-author\u003C/code> or \u003Ccode>dt-published\u003C/code>.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>While these CSS classes make the data machine-interpretable, the same data is still available to the user. There is no duplication like for example the meta tags in OpenGraph.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Since my page is a custom SvelteKit app, it was easy enough to add the CSS classes to the right places. I even took the opportunity to add some more information to the pages, like the author card you see if you scroll to the bottom of this post.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3>Accepting comments and other interactions via Webmentions\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>The standard I wanted to play around with the most are webmentions. A webmention is a sort of notification sent from one website A to another website B, telling B that A has a page linking to it.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In the IndieWeb all types of interactions are just web pages. The microformats2 specification for example allows replies, quotes, likes, bookmarks and many other types of interactions. The receiver of the webmention is free to extract any relevant information from the sender page and might display it, for example as a comment.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Since I already have a \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/Tiim/IndieGo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">small custom service\u003C/a> running for the comment section on this site, I decided to add support to it for receiving webmentions. I refactored the comment system quite a bit to make it more modular and extendable, to allow me to add webmentions\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It currently supports all the required and some optional features for receiving webmentions: The first thing it does is validate the mention. A mention is only valid if the source and target URLs are valid and if the page from the source URL links to the target URL. The next step is extracting some microformat content from the source URL and saving it to the database.\nI found some things unexpectedly tricky to implement: for example, a repeated webmention with the same source URL should update the previously saved webmention if the link to the target page is still there, but delete the webmention if the link was removed.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I have tested my webmentions implementation using \u003Ca href=\"https://webmention.rocks\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">webmention.rocks\u003C/a>, but I would appreciate it if you left me a mention as well 😃\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3>Publishing short-form content such as replies, likes and bookmarks: A notes post type\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>The next thing I wanted to add to my website was sending webmentions. But before I implemented that, I wanted a way to publish short content without spamming my blog feed. For this, I created a new post type called \u003Ca href=\"https://tiim.ch/mf2\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">notes\u003C/a>. The list of notes lives on the /mf2 page because I plan to mostly use it to publish notes that contain microformats2 classes such as replies and likes. Another reason I didn't want to make it accessible as the /notes page is that I plan to publish my Zettelkasten notes eventually, but this is a story for another post.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I also used the opportunity to add an RSS feed for all my posts, pages, projects, and notes: \u003Ca href=\"https://tiim.ch/full-rss.xml\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">full-rss.xml\u003C/a>. I do not recommend you subscribe to it unless you are curious about all changes to the content on my website.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3>Notifying referenced websites: Sending Webmentions\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Sending webmentions was easy compared to receiving webmentions:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>On a regular interval (and on page builds), the server loads the full RSS feed and checks what items have a newer timestamp than the last time. It then extracts a list of all URLs from that feed item and loads the list of URLs that it extracted last time. Then a webmention is sent to all the URLs.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Luckily I did not have to implement any of this myself apart from some glue code to fit it together: I used the library \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/go-co-op/gocron\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">gocron\u003C/a> for scheduling the regular intervals, \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/mmcdole/gofeed\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">gofeed\u003C/a> for parsing the RSS feed and \u003Ca href=\"https://willnorris.com/go/webmention\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">webmention\u003C/a> for extracting links and sending webmentions.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3>In the future: IndieAuth\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>The next thing on my roadmap is implementing IndieAuth. Although not because I have a real use case for it, but because I'm interested in OAuth, the underlying standard, and this seems like a good opportunity to get a deeper understanding of the protocol.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Although, before I start implementing the next things, I should probably focus on writing blog posts first. There is no use in the most advanced blogging system if I can't be bothered to write anything.\u003C/p>\u003Cdiv class=\"mf2\">\u003Cblockquote class=\"syndication\">This post is also on \u003Cul>\u003Cli>\u003Ca class=\"u-syndication\" href=\"https://news.indieweb.org/en\">news.indieweb.org\u003C/a>\u003C/li>\u003C/ul>\u003C/blockquote>\u003C/div>\n","blog/2022-12-indiewebifying-my-website-part-1","3b342241-c414-4670-bd22-03e13d6531b7",["Date","2022-11-12T10:55:14.000Z"],[8],"IndieWebifying my Website Part 1 - Microformats and Webmentions",["Date","2022-12-03T20:56:54.000Z"],"This site now supports sending and receiving webmentions and surfacing structured data using microformats2.","https://i.imgur.com/FpgIBxI.jpg",[151,171,172,173,120,174],"Webmentions","mf2","tiim.ch","indiego",[176],"https://news.indieweb.org/en","\u003Cp>A few weeks ago, I stumbled on one of \u003Ca href=\"https://www.jvt.me/posts/2019/08/21/rsvp-from-your-website/\">Jamie Tanna's blog posts about microformats2\u003C/a> by accident.

If a page or layout needs to perform some asynchronous operation, this should be done inside of this load function. SvelteKit executes this function asynchronously on the server side as well as on the client side and the return value of this function is assigned to the \u003Ccode>data\u003C/code> prop of the associated component. Usually, this asynchronous operation is loading data from an external service, like in the case of this blog post a GraphQL server.\nYou can of course load data directly in the component, but SvelteKit will not wait for this to complete when doing SSR, and the resulting HTML will not include the loaded data.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2>Background - @urql/svelte\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>The urql library allows us to easily issue GraphQL queries and mutations.

I couldn't find any documentation or any articles solving them, so I decided to write down my solutions to those problems in this blog post.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3>Problem 1 - Svelte and urql Reactivity\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Let's say we have the following load function, which executes a GraphQL query to load a list of red cars:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cpre>\u003Ccode class=\"language-js\">// src/routes/car/+page.js\n\n/** @type {import('./$types').PageLoad} */\nexport function load(event) {\n  const client = createClient({\n    url: config.url,\n    fetch: event.fetch,\n  });\n\n  const carColor = \"red\";\n\n  const cars = client\n    .query(carsQuery, {\n      color: carColor,\n    })\n    .toPromise()\n    .then((c) => c.data?.car);\n\n  return {\n    cars,\n  };\n}\n\u003C/code>\u003C/pre>\n\u003Cp>This example uses the urql method \u003Ccode>client.query\u003C/code> to start a query to get us a list of cars with a red colour (The GraphQL query is not shown but the exact query is not important for this example).\nThe client gets a \u003Ca href=\"https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/load#input-methods-fetch\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">special fetch function\u003C/a> from the event which has a few nice properties, like preventing a second network request on the client side if that same request was just issued on the server-side.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Since the query code is now located in the load function and not in a svelte component, there is no way to easily change the \u003Ccode>carColor\u003C/code> and have urql automatically reload the query. The only way to change the variable is to set the value as a query parameter and read that from the \u003Ccode>event\u003C/code> argument. This however means that we have to refresh the whole page just to reload this query.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The other thing urql does for us, reloading the query when we do a mutation on the same data, will not work with the above code either.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3>The solution: A query in the load function and a query in the component\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>To fix those two drawbacks we have to add the same query as in the load function to our component code as well. Unfortunately, this means when a user loads the page, it sends a request from the client side, even though the same request got sent from the server side already.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I created a small wrapper function \u003Ccode>queryStoreInitialData\u003C/code> that creates the query inside of the component and intelligently switches from the (possibly stale) data from the load function to the new data. Using this wrapper, the page or layout might look as follows:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cpre>\u003Ccode class=\"language-svelte\">&#x3C;script>\n  import { queryStoreInitialData } from \"@/lib/gql-client\"; // The helper function mentioned above\n  import { getContextClient } from \"@urql/svelte\";\n  import { carsQuery } from \"./query\"; // The query\n\n  export let data;\n\n  $: gqlStore = queryStoreInitialData(\n    {\n      client: getContextClient(),\n      query: carsQuery,\n    },\n    data.cars\n  );\n  $: cars = $gqlStore?.data?.car;\n&#x3C;/script>\n\n&#x3C;div>\n  &#x3C;pre>\n    {JSON.stringify(cars, null, 2)}\n  &#x3C;/pre>\n&#x3C;/div>\n\u003C/code>\u003C/pre>\n\u003Col>\n\u003Cli>The native \u003Ccode>queryStore\u003C/code> function gets replaced with the wrapper function.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>The initial value of the query is supplied to the wrapper\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ol>\n\u003Cp>Unfortunately, we can not return the query result from the load function directly like this:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cpre>\u003Ccode class=\"language-js\">const result = await client.query(cars, {}).toPromise();\n\nreturn {\n  cars: toInitialValue(result),\n};\n\u003C/code>\u003C/pre>\n\u003Cp>This results in the following error:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cpre>\u003Ccode class=\"language-stacktrace\">Cannot stringify a function (data.events.operation.context.fetch)\nError: Cannot stringify a function (data.events.operation.context.fetch)\n    at render_response (file:///app/node_modules/@sveltejs/kit/src/runtime/server/page/render.js:181:20)\n    at runMicrotasks (&#x3C;anonymous>)\n    at processTicksAndRejections (node:internal/process/task_queues:96:5)\n    at async render_page (file:///app/node_modules/@sveltejs/kit/src/runtime/server/page/index.js:276:10)\n    at async resolve (file:///app/node_modules/@sveltejs/kit/src/runtime/server/index.js:232:17)\n    at async respond (file:///app/node_modules/@sveltejs/kit/src/runtime/server/index.js:284:20)\n    at async file:///app/node_modules/@sveltejs/kit/src/exports/vite/dev/index.js:406:22\n\u003C/code>\u003C/pre>\n\u003Cp>This is because the query result contains data that is not serializable.\nTo fix this I created the \u003Ccode>toInitialValue\u003C/code> function, which deletes all non-serializable elements from the result.

Social media companies deliberately do not want you to limit what is shown to you. It would be too easy to leave and not spend your time watching their precious ads.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>But there is another way! By subscribing to RSS feeds you are in control of what you are shown. Most websites, blogs, news sites and even social media sites provide RSS feeds to subscribe to. You get only the articles, videos or audio content you are subscribed to, without any algorithm messing with your attention.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2>But what exactly is an RSS feed?\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>RSS stands for \"Really Simple Syndication\", and it is a protocol for a website to provide a list of content. It is an old protocol, the first version was introduced in 1999, but it might be more useful nowadays than ever.\nIf you listen to podcasts, you are already familiar with RSS feeds: a podcast is an RSS feed which links to audio files instead of online articles.\nAn RSS feed is just an XML document which contains information about the feed and a list of content.\nWhen you use an app to subscribe to an RSS feed, this app will just save the URL to the XML document and load it regularly to check if new content is available. You are completely in control of how often the feed is refreshed and what feeds you want to subscribe to. Some RSS reader apps also allow you to specify some rules for example about if you should be notified, based on the feed, the content or the tags.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2>How to subscribe to a feed?\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Since an RSS feed is just an XML document, you don't \u003Cem>technically\u003C/em> have to subscribe to a feed to read it, you \u003Cem>could\u003C/em> just open the document and read the XML. But that would be painful. Luckily there are several plugins, apps and services that allow you to easily subscribe to and read RSS feeds.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>If you want to start using RSS and are not sure if you will take the time to open a dedicated app, I would recommend using an RSS plugin for another software that you are using regularly. For example, the \u003Ca href=\"https://thunderbird.net/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Thunderbird\u003C/a> email client already has built-in RSS support. If you want to read to the feeds directly inside of your browser, you can use the \u003Ca href=\"https://nodetics.com/feedbro/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">feedbro\u003C/a> extension for Chrome, Firefox, and other Chromium-based browsers. I use the \u003Ca href=\"https://vivaldi.com\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Vivaldi\u003C/a> browser which comes with an integrated RSS feed reader.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2>What if there is no RSS feed?\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Unfortunately not every website offers an RSS feed. Although it might be worth it to hunt for them. Some websites offer an RSS feed but do not link to it anywhere.\nIf there is no feed, but a newsletter is offered, the service \"\u003Ca href=\"https://kill-the-newsletter.com\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Kill The Newsletter\u003C/a>\" will provide you with email addresses and a corresponding RSS URL to convert any newsletter to a feed. Another service to consider is \u003Ca href=\"http://fetchrss.com\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">FetchRSS\u003C/a>. It turns any website into an RSS feed.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2>RSS Apps\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>If you want to have a dedicated app for your reading, you're in luck! There is a plethora of apps to choose from, all with different features and user interfaces.\nThere are three main types of apps: standalone apps, service-based apps, and self-hosted apps. Most apps are standalone, meaning they fetch the RSS feeds only when open, and don't sync to your other devices. The service-based apps rely on a cloud service which will fetch the feeds around the clock, even when all your devices are off. They can also send you a summary mail if you forget to check for some time and they can sync your subscriptions across all your devices. Unfortunately, most service-based apps only offer a limited experience for free. The last category is self-hosted apps. They are similar to the service based apps but instead of some company running the service, you have to provide a server for the service to run yourself.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I use a standalone app, because I do not want to rely on a service, but I also don't want to go through the hassle of setting up a self-hosted solution.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>If you are still unsure what RSS app you could try out, I provided a list below.

Connect the audio cable to the blue line-in jack on the back of the computer. Then, connect the phone to the other end of the audio cable. If your phone does not have an audio jack, use the adapter on the USB-C or Lightning port. If your PC detects that you connected a new line-in device, it might open the audio settings automatically. If not, right-click on the volume icon on the taskbar next to the clock and select \u003Ccode>Sounds\u003C/code>. Navigate to the \u003Ccode>Input\u003C/code> tab and double click on the Line-In entry (the one with a cable icon). Navigate to the Monitor tab and select the check box for \"Use this device as a playback source\". This will tell windows it should play all sounds received through this input directly to the speakers. Usually this is used to monitor microphones but it works for this use case too. You should now hear any sound from your phone through your PC headphones or speakers. Make sure you turn this checkbox off when you disconnect your phone.
